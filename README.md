# A short introduction to React hooks
This is just a short introduction to give you a feeling of what React hooks are and how you can benefit from it. I'll not go into too many details on React hooks but just give you a glimse of it.

React hooks is the new cool thing in React v16.8 and doesn't contain any breaking changes.

One of the problems React hooks tries to resolve is that it's quite difficult to reuse stateful logic between components.
This was tried earlier by using Higher-Order Component and/or Render Props. The problem with this approach is that it requires you to restructure your components when you use them.

With React hooks it is possible to extract stateful logic from a component so it can be reused and tested independently. This allows you to reuse stateful logic without changing the components hierarchy.

This makes it possible to have simpler and smaller components because now it is possible to separate complexity across each component much easier.


## Higher-Order Component
Higher-Order Components is an advanced technique to React for reusing component logic and is not part of the React API. It is a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

Higher-Order Component simply is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

## Render Props
Render Props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a property whose value is a function.

Render Prop simply takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.


# Demo
Since this is new in React a demo will be showing you a small application using classes and later how to do it with React hooks.

The application contains very simple stateful logic.
The application has two different components that will shown one by one.

The first component is a simple example with a counter using a class and with React hooks. This is just to show how React hooks looks like compared to classes.

The second component contains more logic which makes the component more complex. It calculates the screen size, current mouse position, and do some visualization to make the demo less boring ;-)

## Counter
### React classes
As we see in the class we have a constructor that sets the initial value for the state. Besides that, we bind our functions to have the same this for when we are calling the functions.

The component finally renders the state and gives the possibility to increase the state count value by 1.
This is done by calling the increment function that makes sure to update state by using the function `setState`.

### React hooks
The first thing we see here, compared to the previous, is that we're not using class anymore and the lines of code has decreased from 30 to 16.

In this example we use a default React hook `useState`. `useState` is one of React's hooks that comes with React.
`useState` is a function that takes a value as input which is the initial value of the state (similar to our constructor in the React class example). `useState` then returns an array of two elements - the first one being the state and the second one being the function to update the state (equivalent to `setState`).


## Next example
### React classes
In this example, there have been introduced some more logic to make the component more complex.

Listeners for mouse position and window size are added in `componentDidMount` which is run after first rendering of the component.
Listeners are removed in `componentWillUnmount` which makes sure to remove listeners once the component is unmounted.

Each listener use functions to update the state with the correct values.

Finally, the render function makes sure to render the component with the values from the state.

When we look at this code it looks quite simple and that no big changes are needed. However, if we want to create a new component that uses some of the same logic we can't share the component logic across components. That means there is a need to copy paste the logic regarding mouse position and/or window size.
This leaves us with code duplication that needs to be tested and maintained multiple times.

### React hooks
In the React hook example we see that this is actually stored in 3 different files (windowSize.js, mousePosition.js, app.jsx) but for the sake of the demo, this is merged into one file.
React comes with some default hooks that I'll explain in a bit.

The two custom hooks that we implement here are windowSize.js and mousePosition.js.

windowSize.js is a custom React hook for calculating the window size of the browser. This starts by using `useState` to store width and height. The initial value is window current height and width just like it was in the previous example.

To make sure window size is recalculated on window resize we have to add an event listener. The event listener is added in `useEffect` that is also a default React hook. `useEffect` is equivalent to componentDidMount and returns a function which is equivalent to `componentWillUnmount`.
This gives the same functionality as before when `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` were used.

Finally, the component returns the size variable from `useState` that contains width and height.

In `app.jsx` we use the `useWindowSize` hook that we just created, just like `useState` is used. The only difference here is that `useWindowSize` doesn't take any input and returns an object with width and height.

The same thing as `windowSize.js` happens for `mousePosition.js` but this time it calculates the mouse position.

This leaves us with less code duplication and less verboseness in the code since we can now reuse component logic in multiple components.

`useState` and `useEffect` are the only React hooks that have been introduced in these examples that comes with React. There are some more that can be used in different scenarios but these will not be shown or talked about here.

# Extra
React hooks has got quite popular very fast in the React community. That also means there are already thousands of React hooks that can be used as dependencies.

As I see it this gives less redundancy and code duplication, smaller components and more independent components that result in fewer errors and better readability.

# Run
1. Make sure NodeJS with NPM has been installed on the machine
2. Install dependencies with the command `npm i`
3. Run the project with the command `npm start`

`appClasses.js` is the application created with classes and `appHooks.js` is created with React hooks.

You can decide with `index.js` if you want to run it with classes or React hooks.
